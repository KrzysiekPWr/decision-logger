# decision-logger
This project was a study-related (3rd semester). My task was to write a program for decision logging that focuses on user input validation and serialization using the Model-view-controller (MVC) software design pattern.

## More info
The value of logging decisions is the ability to analyze whether they were good over time. The following program enables the user to:

*   add a new decision (date, component, person, importance level, description/context)

*   view logged decisions (saved in a file using serialization)

*   search for logged decisions (e.g., based on component or person)

Example:

A development team in a company is researching the choice of a database system for a new application. They are considering several options and after making a decision, the project manager logs the information about the decision (available alternatives, arguments for the choice) in the system. This particular approach allows for subsequent analysis.
